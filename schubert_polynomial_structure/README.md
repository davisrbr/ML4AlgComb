# Schubert polynomial structure constants (open problem)

Schubert polynomials \[1,2,3\] are a family of polynomials indexed by permutations of $S_n$. Developed to study the cohomology ring of the flag variety, they have deep connections to algebraic geometry, Lie theory, and representation theory. Despite their geometric origins, Schubert polynomials can be described combinatorially \[4,5\], making them a well-studied object in algebraic combinatorics. An important open problem in the study of Schubert polynomials is understanding their *structure constants*. 

When two Schubert polynomials are multiplied, their product can be written as a linear combination of Schubert polynomials
$\mathfrak{S}\_{\beta} \mathfrak{S}\_{\gamma} = \sum\_{\alpha} c^{\alpha}\_{\beta \gamma} \mathfrak{S}\_{\alpha}$.
The question is whether the $c^{\alpha}\_{\beta \gamma}$ (the *structure constants*) have a combinatorial interpretation. To give an example of what we mean by combinatorial interpretation, when Schur polynomials (which can be viewed as specific case of Schubert polynomials) are multiplied together, the coefficients in the resulting product are equal to the number of semistandard tableaux satisfying certain properties.

## Dataset 
Each instance in this dataset is a triple of permutations $(\beta, \gamma, \alpha)$, labeled by its coefficient $c^{\alpha}\_{\beta \gamma}$ in the expansion of the product $\mathfrak{S}\_{\beta} \mathfrak{S}\_{\gamma}.$ Not all possible triples of permutations are included since the vast majority of these would be zero. The dataset consists of an approximately equal number of zero and nonzero coefficients. We provide datasets for $n = 4, 5, 6$ [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15bERRWWue-3gKSir3hVhfejNTeZJgsl9/view?usp=sharing).

Each instance is a line in the corresponding file so that 
`[1,2,3,5,4],[1,2,3,5,4],[1,2,3,6,4,5];1]`
means that the structure constant $c^{1\;2\;\;3\;6\;4\;5}_{1\;2\;3\;5\;4,1\;2\;3\;5\;4} = 1$.

**Task:** The task is to predict the coefficient $c^{\alpha}\_{\beta \gamma}$.
