# The coefficients of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials (open problem)

Kazhdan-Lusztig (KL) polynomials are polynomials in a variable $q$ and with integer coefficients that (for our purposes) are indexed by a pair of permutations \[1\]. We will write the KL polynomial associated with permutations $\sigma$ and $\nu$ as $P_{\sigma,\nu}(q)$. For example, the KL polynomial associated with permutations $\sigma = 1$ $4$ $3$ $2$ $7$ $6$ $5$ $10$ $9$ $8$ $11$ and $\nu = 4$ $6$ $7$ $8$ $9$ $10$ $1$ $11$ $2$ $3$ $5$ is

$P_{\sigma,\nu} = 1 + 16q + 103q^2 + 337q^3 + 566q^4 + 529q^5 + 275q^6 + 66q^7 + 3q^8.$

KL polynomials have deep connections throughout several areas of mathematics. KL polynomials are related to the dimensions of intersection homology in Schubert calculus, the study of the Hecke algebra, and representation theory of the symmetric group. They can be computed via a recursive formula [\[1\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01390031), nevertheless, in many ways they remain mysterious. For instance, there is no known closed formula for the degree of $P_{\sigma,\nu}(q)$.

One family of questions revolve around the coefficients of $P_{\sigma,\nu}(q)$. For instance, it has been hypothesized that the coefficient on the term $q^{\ell(\sigma) - \ell(\nu)-1/2}$ (where $\ell(x)$ is a statistic called the length of the permutation), which is known as the $\mu$-coefficient, has a combinatorial interpretation but currently this is not known. Better understanding of this and other coefficients would be of significant interest to mathematicians from a range of fields.

**Dataset:** Each instance in this dataset consists of a pair of permutations on $n$, $\sigma$ and $\nu$, along with the coefficients of $P_{\sigma,\nu}(q)$. We provide $n = 8,9$.

**Task:** The task to predict the coefficients of $P_{\sigma,\nu}(q)$ given $\sigma$ and $\nu$ (below, we only show results for predicting the coefficient on $q^2$).

We link to datasets generated by Greg Warrington and associated with \[2\]. The dataset for $n = 8$ can be found [here](https://gswarrin.w3.uvm.edu/research/klc/eps-s8-klps) and the dataset for $n = 9$ can be found [here](https://gswarrin.w3.uvm.edu/research/klc/eps-s9-klps). We provide code to do formatting and make official train/test splits in the this repo.

## Data itself

If $v =$ $0$ $2$ $1$ $3$ $5$ $4$ $6$ $9$ $7$ $8$ and $w=2$ $3$ $0$ $5$ $9$ $6$ $7$ $8$ $1$ $4$ then $P_{v,w}(q) = 4q^4+12q^3+13q^2+6q+1$ and this is written as the line
