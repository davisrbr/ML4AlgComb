# Grassmannian Cluster Algebras and Semistandard Young Tableau (open problem)

The Grassmann manifold $\text{Gr}(k,n)$ is the set of full-rank $k \times n$ matrices up to equivalence of elementary row operations (equivalently the space whose points are $k$-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$). Grassmannians are of fundamental geometric importance and are a central tool in a model of quantum field theory known as supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. 

Among the many algebraic-combinatorial properties of Grassmannians is an algebraic structure on its coordinate ring making it a cluster algebra. A recent result of Chang, Duan, Fraser, and Li \[1\] parameterize cluster variables of the Grassmannian coordinate ring in terms of equivalence classes of semistandard Young tableaux. Not every semistandard Young tableaux indexes a cluster variable and a natural question to ask is which are valid cluster variable indices. A necessary condition is that the tableaux is of rectangular shape. We follow the set-up set up of \[2\] who first applied machine learning to this problem, though we choose a different method of sampling tableau that do not index cluster variables.

**Dataset:** A collection of rectangular semistandard Young tableau each with a label indicating whether they index a cluster variable or not.

**Task:** Predict whether a Young tableaux indexes a cluster variable.

## Data itself

The dataset we provide consists of tableau of shape $3 \times 4$, filled with values from $1,2,\dots,12$. The files we provide are: 
- ``3_4_12_invalid_train.txt``
- ``3_4_12_invalid_test.txt``

These contain tableau that do not correspond to cluster variables, `invalid examples'. Files containing the valid examples can be obtained at [https://github.com/edhirst/GrassmanniansML](https://github.com/edhirst/GrassmanniansML). We will provide code at [https://github.com/pnnl/ML4AlgComb](https://github.com/pnnl/ML4AlgComb) to generate the full splits from the data obtained at these two sources.

We use braces $[$ and $]$ to demarcate rows of the dataset, so that

``[[2, 3, 4, 7], [3, 5, 6, 8], [4, 9, 11, 12]]``

corresponds to the tableau pictured in Figure
